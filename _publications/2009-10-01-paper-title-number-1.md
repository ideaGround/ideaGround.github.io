On most social media platforms, various forms of inequality persist, affecting different groups within the community.

1. There is inequality between content creators and social media platforms.
2. Inequality also exists between content creators and readers/supporters.
3. There is inequality among co-writers.

> "Creators who are part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) are eligible to earn money from ads displayed on their videos. The revenue generated from YPP ads is split between YouTube and the creator. YouTube typically keeps 45% of the revenue."  
*-- YouTube*.

At ideaGround, we firmly believe in equality. Unlike many other platforms, <span style="color:orange"> ideaGround do not take any commission from content creators</span>. Instead, we empower them to fully benefit from their contents.

Moreover, we recognize the invaluable role played by supporters in the success of content
creators. Therefore, <span style="color:orange">ideaGround implements a revenue-sharing system called social media economics that ensures supporters are fairly rewarded for their contributions</span>.

In essence, ideaGround is committed to building a community where everyoneâ€”creators and supporters can thrive together, empowered by <span style="color:orange">a truly equitable social media ecosystem</span>.
