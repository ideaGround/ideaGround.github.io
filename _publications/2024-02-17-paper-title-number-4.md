In this digital age, <span style="color:orange">user’s words, ideas, and creations are their intellectual properties</span>. However, these valuable assets are increasingly under threat.

One significant concern is <span style="color:orange">intellectual property accessibility</span>. Social media platforms have
the capability to tamper with or remove users’ content, rendering it inaccessible to users.

Moreover, in the event of a platform crash, all users’ valuable <span style="color:orange">intellectual properties could vanish</span> without a trace, leading a significant loss for entire communities.

Another pressing issue is <span style="color:orange">intellectual property infringement</span>. Unfortunately, many social media platforms do not prioritize the detection and punishment of such theft.
