<span style="color:orange">Social media is heavily influenced by government and censorship</span>, especially in places where authoritarian regimes hold sway. 

This means that what you see and hear online may be biased or even controlled by the government. Censorship limits people’s access to different perspectives of information, <span style="color:orange">which leads misinformation and echo chamber</span>.

> Political writing in our time consists almost entirely of prefabricated phrases bolted together like the pieces of a child's Meccano set. It is the unavoidable result of self-censorship. 
*-- George Orwell*

The commerce conducted on ideaGround operates with utmost <span stype="color:orange">transparency</span> and is <span style="color:orange">closely monitored by the community</span>.
